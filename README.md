# Trello done checkbox for Tampermonkey &amp; Greasemonkey
A [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) plugin that greatly simplifies creation of 'Done' checkboxes. Only one mouse click required! To achieve the same thing with a built-in checklist you definitely need more patience :)

[Install it now!](http://bit.ly/2aH380F)*
